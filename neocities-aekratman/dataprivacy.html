<h1>What Can I Do?</h1>
</div>
 <div class="firesans">
<h2>Start caring about your data!</h2><em>
Download a VPN from places like Mullvad or Nord.
Talk to your politicians and your community about what you want to see from the government-- local and nation-wide-- about privacy online!</li>
Become more tech literate!</li>
Stop signing things without knowing what they mean!</em>

<h2>No matter what: We can build a better world, where opensource software and private data are the norm instead of something we must fight for!</h2>
